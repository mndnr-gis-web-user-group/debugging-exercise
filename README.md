# debugging-exercise  

**The work you submit is a representation of YOUR abilities as a Web Developer; abilities that you can quickly and efficiently bring to this position. Please consider this before accessing outside resources to complete this exercise. Every developer uses web searches to find the best solution from time to time; that is expected and encouraged. Consulting your developer friend or colleague is discouraged.**
